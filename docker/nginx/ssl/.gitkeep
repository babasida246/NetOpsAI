# SSL Certificate Placeholder
# 
# Place your SSL certificates here:
# - cert.pem: SSL certificate
# - key.pem: SSL private key
#
# For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
#   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#     -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
#     -subj "/CN=localhost"
#
# For production, use certificates from a trusted CA like Let's Encrypt
